geosrs:CoastalHydrography,geosrs:Hydrography,,coastal hydrography,"Hydrographic surveying & monitoring focused on nearshore waters, where navigation safety and coastal change are most critical.",SRS Application Types,,,geocrs:CoastalHydrography,coastal hydrography,,Extension
geosrs:OffshoreEngineering,geosrs:SRSApplication,,offshore engineering,"Offshore engineering (also called ocean engineering or marine engineering in some contexts) is the branch of engineering concerned with the design, construction, installation, and maintenance of structures and systems in the ocean environment, such as oil and gas platforms, subsea pipelines, and renewable energy facilities.",SRS Application Types,,,geocrs:OffshoreEngineering,offshore engineering,,Extension
geosrs:Hydrography,geosrs:SRSApplication,,hydrography,"Hydrography is the branch of applied sciences which deals with the measurement and description of the physical features of oceans, seas, coastal areas, lakes, and rivers, as well as the prediction of their change over time, for the primary purpose of safety of navigation and in support of all other marine activities, including economic development, security and defense, scientific research, and environmental protection.",SRS Application Types,,,geocrs:Hydrography,hydrography,,Extension
geosrs:Drilling,geosrs:SRSApplication,,drilling,"Drilling is the process of creating holes in the ground (or other solid materials) using specialized tools, widely applied in energy, construction, mining, and manufacturing.",SRS Application Types,,,geocrs:Drilling,drilling,,Extension
