.Preface

This document establishes the OGC CRS ontology and its submodules.
The definition of elements of coordinate reference systems is an essential part of geospatial data provision.
However, until now, coordinate reference systems and their components could not be represented in an OGC-standardized semantic web vocabulary.
This document introduces the ontology model, its classes and properties, application examples and can serve as the foundation of a semantic web based coordinate system registry at OGC.
Special attention is given to the compatibility of the CRS Ontology vocabulary to other OGC-endorsed Semantic Web standards such as GeoSPARQL and alignments to other data standards are provided as part of this specification.

====
Insert Preface Text here. Give OGC specific commentary: describe the technical content, reason for document, history of the document and precursors, and plans for future work.

There are two ways to specify the Preface: "simple clause" or "full clasuse"

If the Preface does not contain subclauses, it is considered a simple preface clause. This one is entered as text after the `.Preface` label and must be placed between the AsciiDoc document attributes and the first AsciiDoc section title. It should not be give a section title of its own.

If the Preface contains subclauses, it needs to be encoded as a full preface clause. This one is recognized as a full Metanorma AsciiDoc section with te title "Preface", i.e. `== Preface`. (Simple preface content can also be encoded like full preface.)

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

== Security Considerations

//If no security considerations have been made for this Standard, use the following text.

No security considerations have been made for this Standard.

////
If security considerations have been made for this Standard, follow the examples found in IANA or IETF documents. Please see the following example.

“VRRP is designed for a range of internetworking environments that may employ different security policies. The protocol includes several authentication methods ranging from no authentication, simple clear text passwords, and strong authentication using IP Authentication with MD5 HMAC. The details on each approach including possible attacks and recommended environments follows.

Independent of any authentication type VRRP includes a mechanism (setting TTL=255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP packets being injected from another remote network. This limits most vulnerabilities to local attacks.
NOTE: The security measures discussed in the following sections only provide various kinds of authentication. No confidentiality is provided at all. This should be explicitly described as outside the scope....”
