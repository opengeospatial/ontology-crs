[[core]]

This clause establishes the *Core* Requirements class, with IRI `/req/core`, which has a corresponding Conformance Class, *Core*, with IRI `/conf/core`.

The Core module establishes a set of classes and properties which define the building blocks of a spatial reference system definition.
Some of the definitions are extended in specialized modules related to the Core module.

From a base class SpatialReferenceSystem, we define a class for a coordinate system, as the superclass of all spatial reference systems describing locations using coorindates.
These SpatialReferenceSystems are described using a Datum and a coordinate system definitions with at least one coordinate axis.
Together with several subtypes of coordnate reference system, these definitions complete the Core module.
