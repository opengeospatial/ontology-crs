[discrete]
=== Overview

=== Compatibility to PROJJSON

https://proj.org/en/stable/specifications/projjson.html[PROJSON] is an established format to share geospatial data which has emerge from the PROJ library and encodes the WKT encoding of coordiante references systems.
By adding a JSON-LD context to the PROJJSON standard we achieve an immediate compatibility with an established standard simply by extending it by one simple statement.

{
    "@context": "https://opengeospatial.github.io/ontology-crs/context/geosrs-context.json",
    "$schema": "https://proj.org/schemas/v0.7/projjson.schema.json",
    ...
}

We provide examples of application of this JSON-LD context with the distribution of this standard.
